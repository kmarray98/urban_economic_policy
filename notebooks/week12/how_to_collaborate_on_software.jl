# How to collaborate on software



What is the simplest way to collaborate on project online? You can _email files to each other!_ This works for small projects, but at some point, you will need something more suited to the task. For example:

- Encyclopedia -- a wiki system
- School essay -- Google Drive
- **Software project -- GitHub**

For software projects, people of use GitHub, or similar (git-based) tools to collaborate on their work. Why is that?

# Why not Google Drive?
"""

# ╔═╡ 56db20a5-0e8d-4d34-b3ba-c3ab1b8de58e
md"""
Google Drive (or Dropbox, Nextcloud, etc) is a platform for _realtime collaboration_ on files. Besides synchronizing single files (like the video above), Google Drive also allows you to synchronize entire folders between multiple computers and the cloud. That's awesome! So do people use it for collaborative software projects?

Well, generally not. Software projects have some unique properties that require different tools. **As today's introduction into _git_, let's look at the differences between a software project and a non-software project**, and why platforms like Google Drive don't work well for collaborating on code.

Note that we will take a different perspective that other introductions to _git_. Let's start out with a realtime-synchronization system like Google Drive as our default, and think about why we might want to change its functionality to make it more suitable for software.

## Reason 1: sensitive to change

> **Reason 1:** In software projects, small changes often make a big difference. **Changes to one file affect the entire program.**

For example, here is what Pluto.jl looks like after adding **a single character** to the source code:

"""

# ╔═╡ 604837c5-b017-4d6c-a5c5-dab50d5f3f61
md"""
While a single character can mean disaster, this _sensitivity_ also means that programming languages are quite powerful! A small change will often do the trick.
"""

# ╔═╡ 8678b5e1-0b67-4097-82ba-0daa4e878032
md"""
### Synchronizing every change

This sensitivity to changes makes realtime synchronization unsuitable for software projects. To see why, let's say that I want to change `sqrt` to `log` in the following code:
"""

# ╔═╡ 02905480-8864-4e56-af3a-6c7c0789ce6f


# ╔═╡ 2ef5db21-0092-4523-b930-0ec99c459ffa
md"""
If you would synchronize every change while making that edit (removing the letters `s`, `q`, `r`, `t`, typing `l`, `o`, `g`), then you are **publishing broken code** to your online code repository. If you were sharing changes in realtime (like Google Drive), then other people would get those broken states while working on their features.
"""

# ╔═╡ 51114dc9-cb32-4d31-b780-6f5e372f8763

##### Synchronizing every _keystroke_
"""

# ╔═╡ dfb316ca-0502-4419-93c2-6d455b7b2f98
md"""
However, if we only publish code _manually_, we can make sure that we never publish broken code. This means that my collaborators, who might be working on the project at the same time, will not have to deal with errors that are coming from my work-in-progress changes.
"""

# ╔═╡ ae28cad6-2ffe-48b4-895b-fab1bd2f2443
md"""
##### Synchronizing manually
"""

# ╔═╡ ee5a3219-4547-4a9d-b527-3489a2925f68
md"""
### Even larger chunks

In the previous example, we found that we can avoid publishing _invalid syntax_ by not synchronizing on every keystroke like Google Docs, but by synchronizing manually.

We also don't want to synchronize the file every time it is _saved_, because you often try multiple things before finding something that works.

### Reason 2: _branches_ and _forks_

> **Reason 2:** It should be easy to split a project into multiple _branches_: **copies of the codebase** that can be worked on independently. And after some time, we want to **compare branches** and merge the new additions into one.

Something that you may have done: create a copy of your `presentation.ppt` called `presentation-with-pictures.ppt` before adding your pictures, and if it didn't work, you can go back to yesterday's backup.

Now that's great, but what if your teammate also made a copy `presentation-with-titlepage.ppt` where they also made a change? In this situation, you have created two _branches_ of the same file in parallel, and it will be **difficult to combine those changes** back into a single `presentation-this-one-really.ppt` file.

md"""
### Reason 3: automation

> **Reason 3:** Git is a platform for **automation**, and can be a mechanism to automatically test and review changes, release weekly versions, etc etc.

Programmers _love_ to automate things, and git allows all sorts of automation. At first, this can be **intimidating**, and it will take years of experience to learn all the possible tricks. Someone who does 'git magic' as a profession is called a _[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) engineer_. Don't worry about this too much when getting started with GitHub, and ask others for help if necessary.

While we don't recommend learning about _git automation_ right away, one thing you will probably encounter when contributing to an open source project is **automatic testing**. More on this later!

# Our first contribution: _documentation_

Today will be a kick-start into contributing to open source projects! The easiest way to make a great contribution to packages is to contribute a _documentation improvement_. For our example today, we will look at the package [ClimateMARGO.jl](https://github.com/ClimateMARGO/ClimateMARGO.jl), a climate-economic model.

This package is hosted on GitHub, which means that all code and previous versions of code is available at [github.com/ClimateMARGO/ClimateMARGO.jl](https://github.com/ClimateMARGO/ClimateMARGO.jl). The authors also use the same GitHub site to manage their TO-DOs — called [Issues](https://github.com/ClimateMARGO/ClimateMARGO.jl/issues) — and to accept contributions from others — called [Pull Requests](https://github.com/ClimateMARGO/ClimateMARGO.jl/pulls). Today, we are going to make a Pull Request!

### What is a Pull Request?

Julia packages are _open source_, which means that you are allowed (and encouraged) to make your own copy of the source code (we call this a _**fork**_) and modify it. 

If you made some good changes on your fork then you can suggest to changes to the original project by submitting your code as a _**Pull Request (PR)**_. This is a feature built-in to GitHub, and this is how most code collaboration happens online.

## _After_ the Pull Request

Submitting your Pull Request is a great feeling, but it's not the last step! After your submission, the PR will be reviewed by the project authors, and they will leave their feedback. It is common that a PR is not _merged_ (accepted) directly, but that you are asked to make some small changes.

This is possible because a Pull Request is not static — you can make changes to the PR after submitting it! Remember that a PR is _from one branch to another_. You can make changes to your PR simply by adding additional commits to the _from_ branch.

##### Requirements

To follow this introduction, you will need:
- Create an account at [github.com](github.com). Add a friendly profile picture!
- For Windows & MacOS users, download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), a graphical program to easily manage git repositories on your disk. Linux users can use the slightly more advanced program [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/).
- A code editor. If you don't have a code editor yet, or if you are using Notepad, gedit or Notepad++, we highly recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), an open source, beginner-friendly programming environment. _It may seem like something new and difficult to learn, but it is easy to use, and because it **understands** the code that you are writing, it will help you as a beginner programmer._

## ⛑ Git trouble!

Sooner or later, you will find yourself in _git trouble_. Unlike Google Drive, it can happen that synchronization requires manual intervention, for example, git might say:

#### `🤐 merge conflict`

Which means that someone changed a file right before you were going to commit.

##### Step 1

Use GitHub Desktop to find out which files you have changed. Are the changes important?

##### Step 2

Take any files that you want to keep, and copy them to a different folder, e.g. your desktop.

##### Step 3

**Remove your local clone of the repository, and move any leftover files to the trash.**

##### Step 4

Clone the repository again, and copy your files back to their original place, overwriting the cloned files.

### Tests

People often write _tests_ for their code! As part of the codebase, there will be a `test` folder containing scripts that will import the project and run some basic checks.

md"""
One reason to write tests is to _pin_ specific behaviour, protecting yourself from accidentally changing it later. For example, if you fix a bug that `double(2)` returns `40` instead of `4`, you would also add a test for `double(2) == 4`. Months later, when you are changing `double` for another use case, the old test insures that you are not accidentally breaking something that was once fixed.

#### Running tests

You can run the tests of any Julia package by opening the Julia REPL, and typing:

As mentioned before, many project use _github magic_ to automatically run their tests on a server for every change, and you can view the test results online. An important application is running tests for every Pull Request. This means that package authors can quickly review your changes, knowing that it does not break anything.

    _Language design side note:_ There _are_ languages that are designed to be robust against small changes, and you can actually use realtime collaboration with those! Examples are [glitch.com](glitch.com) for collaborative HTML and CSS editing _(these languages can ignore syntax errors and continue)_, and the more experimental language [_Dark_](https://darklang.com/) _(which uses a special editor that does not allow you to type errors)_.

> ##### Test-driven design
> 
> Some people like to _first_ write their tests, which will fail initially, and _then_ write the code to solve the problem. While working on the code, they keep re-running the tests, until all checks are green! This can be an effective and rewarding way to work on a software problem!

> If you are following this course, then you will already be familiar with this concept! The homework exercises were all designed with the test-driven principle.
