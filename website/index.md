# Urban economic challenges and policies

Here we present the materials from the TAs and simulations of the models from the 2023 course material in interactive notebooks that you can run online without any programming experience. You can use these to explore the models and get intuition for how they work. The course is part of the Msc Spatial, Transport, and Environmental Economics at School of Business and Economics, VU Amsterdam.

You can use this website two ways.

## Way 1) - with Julia

This website and all the models are written in the Julia programming language. So the first way to run the models interactively is to install Julia and then run the notebooks locally. Julia is a fantastic programming language, so I recommend that you do it this way, but you do not have to. To install Julia, go to [the download page](https://julialang.org/downloads/), and follow the download instructions for your OS. Once you have downloaded Julia, you need to install the packages
at the top of the script. To install these open the command prompt, type 'julia' and press enter. That will open a Julia script. Click backspace to get to
the package manager. Then write `add' followed by the name of each package separated by a comma. You need to install the package 'Pluto'. Next, open the page, click run in the top right corner, and select run locally. Then, follow the instructions there.

## Way 2) - on the cloud

The second way is to run this in the browser. This is a bit slow, but works without having to install Julia. To do this, click 'run' in the top right corner of the notebook and then select the 'Binder' option. It will take a few minutes to load (you will see a progress bar at the top of the screen). After loading, you should be able to alter parameters in the site with a small lag.

For general course material, see the Canvas page.
